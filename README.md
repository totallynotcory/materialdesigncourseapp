Project built for the Udacity Android Nanodegree

Description:
------------
You may have experienced this in the past:  You open an app only to see that the colors are too dark, the font is tiny and hard to read, nothing seems sized quite right, and its harder to use because of it.  In the past, there were no standards for how to design Apps and looking back at older apps, you can tell.  In the more recent generations this has been fixed, with Material Design being the latest set of design standards.  For the fifth App in the Udacity Android Nanodegree, students are asked to spiffy up an already existing App and conform to Material Design standards.

Getting Started

"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
